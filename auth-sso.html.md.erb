This topic describes [Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg;](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) authentication and single sign-on configuration with Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) and Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML). Connecting Elastic Runtime to either the LDAP or SAML external user store allows the User Account and Authentication (UAA) server to authenticate users and extends features native to those integrations, such as search, bind and assertion.

If your user store is exposed as a SAML or LDAP Identity Provider for single sign-on (SSO), you can set up SSO to allow users to access the [Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg;](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) [Apps Manager](../console/index.html) without creating a new account or re-entering credentials.

The Cloud Foundry User Account and Authentication ([UAA](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa/tree/develop)) server provides identity management for Elastic Runtime in three ways:

* Issues tokens for use by client applications when they act on behalf of Elastic Runtime users
* Authenticates users with their Elastic Runtime credentials
* Acts as an SSO service using Elastic Runtime or other credentials

See [Adding Existing LDAP Users to a PCF Deployment](../customizing/ldap-user-management.html) for information about managing user identity with LDAP in PCF.

Refer to the instructions in the sections below to configure your deployment with SAML or LDAP, as appropriate:

##<a id="configure-pcf"></a>Configure PCF for SAML

You must configure Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) so that your Identity Provider can recognize PCF as a Service Provider. Follow the instructions below:

1. From the **Installation Dashboard**, click the **Elastic Runtime** tile.
1. Select the **Domains** tab to verify your system domain.

	<%= image_tag("new-domains.png") %>
1. Select **Authentication and Enterprise SSO**.

	<%= image_tag("sso-ert.png") %>

1. Select **SAML Identity Provider**.

1. Enter a **Provider Name**. Your provider name appears as a link on your Pivotal login page, which you can access at `https://login.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN`, which you retrieved above. When prompted:
	* Create a passphrase. Ops Manager encrypts data using the passphrase that you provide.
	* Read the **End User License Agreement**, and select the checkbox to accept the terms.
	* Click **Setup Authentication**.

	<%= image_tag("meta-url.png") %>

1. Your Identity Provider login page appears. Enter your username and password. Click Login.

1. Retrieve the metadata from your Identity Provider and copy it into either the **Provider Metadata** or the **Provider Metadata URL** fields, depending on whether your Identity Provider exposes a Metadata URL. Pivotal recommends that you complete Provider Metadata URL rather than the Provider Metadata field because the metadata can change. You can do this by either of the following:
	* If your Identity Provider exposes a Metadata URL, provide the Metadata URL.
	* Download your Identity Provider metadata and paste this XML into the **Provider Metadata** area.
		Ensure that the XML declaration tag is present at the beginning of the Metadata XML. For example:
		<pre>
		<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
		&lt;EntityDescriptor&gt;
		&lt;/EntityDescriptor&gt;
		</pre>
	

	<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: You only need to select one of the above configurations. If you configure both, your Identity Provider defaults to the <strong>(OR) Provider Metadata URL</strong>.</p>

1. Click **Save**.

1. Click **Apply Changes** on the Ops Manager home page for the configuration to take effect.

##<a id="configure-identity-provider"></a>Configure Your SAML Identity Provider for PCF

You must configure your Identity Provider to recognize PCF as a Service Provider.

Download the Service Provider Metadata from `https://login.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN/saml/metadata`. Consult the documentation for your Identity Provider for configuration instructions.

Refer to the table below for information about certain industry-standard Identity Providers and how to integrate them with Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg;:

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Some Identity Providers allow uploads of Service Provider Metadata. Other providers require you to manually enter the Service Provider Metadata into a form.</p>

## <a id="configure-ldap"></a>Configuring PCF for LDAP

To integrate the UAA with LDAP, configure Elastic Runtime with your LDAP endpoint information as follows:

1. Log into the Pivotal Cloud Foundry Operations Manager web interface.

1. On the Product Dashboard, select **Pivotal Elastic Runtime**.

    <%=image_tag("uaa/er-tile.png")%>

1. In the left navigation menu, select **LDAP Config**.

1. Enter the following LDAP endpoint configuration information:
    * **LDAP Server URL**: A URL pointing to the LDAP server.
This must include one of the following protocols:
        * `ldap://`: This specifies that the LDAP server uses an unencrypted connection.
        * `ldaps://`: This specifies that the LDAP server uses SSL for an encrypted connection and requires that the LDAP server holds a trusted certificate or that you import a trusted certificate to the JVM truststore.
    * **LDAP Credentials**: The LDAP Distinguished Name (DN) and password for binding to the LDAP Server. Example DN: `cn=administrator,ou=Users,dc=example,dc=com`
<br /><br />
    Note: We recommend that you provide LDAP credentials that grant read-only permissions on the LDAP Search Base and the LDAP Group Search Base.
<br /><br />
    * **LDAP Search Base**: The location in the LDAP directory tree from which any LDAP User search begins.
	The typical LDAP Search Base matches your domain name.
<br /><br />
    For example, a domain named "cloud.example.com" typically uses the following LDAP User Search Base: `ou=Users,dc=example,dc=com`
<br /><br />
    * **LDAP Search Filter**: A string that defines LDAP User search criteria. These search criteria allow LDAP to perform more effective and efficient	searches. For example, the standard LDAP search filter `cn=Smith` returns all objects with a common name equal to `Smith`.
<br /><br />
	In the LDAP search filter string that you use to configure Elastic Runtime,	use `{0}` instead of the username. For example, use `cn={0}` to return all LDAP objects with the same common
	name as the username.
<br /><br />
    In addition to `cn`, other attributes commonly searched for and returned are `mail`, `uid` and, in the case of Active Directory, `sAMAccountName`.
<br /><br />
    * **LDAP Group Search Base**: The location in the LDAP directory tree from which the LDAP Group search begins.
<br /><br />
    For example, a domain named "cloud.example.com" typically uses the following LDAP Group Search Base: `ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com`
<br /><br />
	Follow the instructions in [Granting Admin Permissions to an LDAP Group](../adminguide/uaa-user-management.html#ldap-group) in _Creating and Managing Users with the UAA CLI (UAAC)_ to map the groups under this search base to Admin roles in Pivotal Cloud Foundry.
<br /><br />
    You must use the Cloud Foundry command line interface (cf CLI) to map other	roles in Pivotal Cloud Foundry to individual users. See [Creating and Managing Users with the cf CLI](../adminguide/cli-user-management.html) for more information.
<br /><br />
    * **LDAP Group Search Filter**: A string that defines LDAP Group search	criteria. The standard value is `member={0}`.
