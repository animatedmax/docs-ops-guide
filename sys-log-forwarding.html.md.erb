## <a id='syslog-forward'></a> Enabling System Log Forwarding ##

Elastic Runtime can forward log data to an external aggregator service instead of routing it to the Loggregator Firehose. System log forwarding for [Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg;](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) is managed through the **PCF Ops Manager Installation Dashboard**. To enable syslog forwarding:

1. Click the **Elastic Runtime** tile.
1. Select **System Logging**.
1. Enter the Hostname, Port, and Protocol for your third-party log management service.
1. (Optional) Increase the drain buffer size to prevent loss of log data.
1. Click **Save**.
1. Click **Apply Changes**.
